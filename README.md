### Introduction to Stata (ECON 494)
*Course description:* This short course introduces students to the data analysis and statistical software tools used in upper-level econometrics and applied economics courses. The course is designed to serve as a bridge between introductory econometrics and practical work with real-world databases. The course will be held in the computer classroom so that students can obtain hands-on experience with data preparation, workflow, and modeling using the Stata statistical software package. Emphasis throughout the course is placed on examples of applications in economics. 

*Language Used:* STATA

*Grade Earned:* A

*Semester:* Fall 2019

### Economic Analysis with Excel (ECON 4941)
*Course description:* This mini course offers students the opportunity to master the advance functionality of Microsoft Excel, and to apply those skills to common economic, statistical, and financial problems. Even those familiar with the basic functioning of Excel may be surprised to learn how little of its full capability most users access. Though basic functions will be covered, our focus will be on leveraging Excel's more advanced functions, analytical tools, reporting templates, and linking features to manage multiple workbooks, manipulate data across files, automate tasks, and produce publication quality charts, tables, and graphs. In addition to providing hands-on experience using Excel's advanced capabilities, the course is designed to serve as a bridge between introductory econometrics and practical work with real-world datasets. 

*Language Used:* Excel

*Grade Earned:* A

*Semester:* Fall 2019
